# Next.js Data Fetching Examples

This Next.js project demonstrates three methods for fetching data and using that
data to generate Next.js pages:

- Server-side fetching and generation with `getServerSideProps`
- Static/build-time fetching and incremental regeneration with `getStaticProps`
- Static/build-time generation with data fetching provided by
  [GitHub “Flat Data”](https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data)

I specifically wanted to illustrate how GitHub Flat Data could be useful for
generating type definitions, and thought it would be helpful to see how these
three methods differ and offer different advantages.
